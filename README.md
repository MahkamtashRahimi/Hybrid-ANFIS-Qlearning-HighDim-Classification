A hybrid neuro-fuzzy classification framework for high-dimensional data using ANFIS, Q-learning, LDA, and PSO.

# Hybrid ANFIS-Qlearning for High-Dimensional Data Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project proposes a hybrid neuro-fuzzy classification framework for high-dimensional datasets, combining:
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis): Reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving class separability.
- PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization): Selects the most relevant features.
- ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System): Performs classification using a neuro-fuzzy approach.
- Q-learning: Dynamically tunes ANFIS parameters for improved performance.

The framework aims to efficiently handle high-dimensional data by reducing complexity while improving classification accuracy.

## 🎯 Objective
To achieve higher classification accuracy and faster computation in high-dimensional datasets by integrating dimensionality reduction, feature selection, neuro-fuzzy inference, and reinforcement learning.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply LDA to reduce the dimensionality of input data.
2. Feature Selection: Use PSO to select the most informative features from the reduced dataset.
3. Classification: Train ANFIS on the selected features for accurate classification.
4. Dynamic Optimization: Optimize ANFIS parameters adaptively using Q-learning to further enhance performance.
